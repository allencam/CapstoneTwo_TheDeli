# The Deli

## Overview
Welcome to **The Deli**! This is my command line application, written in Java, that functions as a point-of-sale system
allowing users to build an order consisting of:
- One or more sandwiches with various toppings, 
- One or more drinks and/or chips from a small variety
- The ability to save a timestamped itemized receipt to a dedicated folder

## Features
- Add sandwiches with customizable toppings (meats, cheeses, vegetables, sauces, etc.).
- Select drinks and chips to include in the order.
- Display and review the current order, categorized by item type.
- Save an itemized order receipt to a `.txt` file with a timestamped name.
- Remove or edit individual items from the order.

## Usage

1. Run the program and follow the prompts to:
   - Add sandwiches with up to 2 meats, cheeses, and unlimited other toppings.
   - Select drinks and chips to complete the order.
   - Review your order and make changes before finalizing.
2. Save the receipt, which will be stored as a timestamped `.txt` file in the `OrderReceipts` folder.
